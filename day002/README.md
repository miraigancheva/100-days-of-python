# Day 002 â€” Tip Calculator ðŸ’¸

## Goal
Practice Python basics:

- Numbers and floating-point values
- Type conversion with `int()` and `float()`
- Arithmetic operations
- Using f-strings for formatting

## Project Description
This program calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including tip:

1. Ask for the total bill.  
2. Ask for the percentage tip.  
3. Ask for the number of people splitting.  
4. Calculate each personâ€™s share, formatted to 2 decimal places.

Itâ€™s a practical way to learn math operations and f-strings in Python.

## Example Run
```text
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? 150.00
What percentage tip would you like to give? 12
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: 33.60
