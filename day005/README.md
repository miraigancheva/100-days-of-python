# Day 005 â€” Password Generator ðŸ”‘

## Goal
Practice Python basics:
- `for` loops
- Working with lists
- Using the `random` module
- Generating randomized strings

## Project Description
This program generates a secure random password.  
The user chooses how many letters, symbols, and numbers to include.  
The program then:
1. Selects random characters from the chosen categories  
2. Shuffles them to ensure randomness  
3. Joins them into a final password string  

## Example Run
```text
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
4
How many symbols would you like?
2
How many numbers would you like?
2
Your password: Ghdj$%48
